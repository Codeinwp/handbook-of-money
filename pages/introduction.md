Money is like cats. You can raise them, groom them, and play with them. But at the end of the day, they do what they want. You are the only one who thinks that they belong to you. Cats are always thinking that you are a mere servant.

Right now, you are making money mainly from a salary. From a salary three paths open up:

1. Grow your salary.
2. Invest a small portion of it.
3. Open a business.

To grow your salary, you need to increase your labor value. To open a business, you will need an idea and some capital. Both are hard to do, but you can make money in the short term (1-5 years).

With investment in things like bonds, stocks, index funds, you are playing a long-term game. You don't have to do much about money. Money increases its value by simply moving from pocket to pocket. BUT you need to be prepared when you cash them out (7 - 3o years).

You are thinking that investment is for people who know a lot about the domains. But in reality, nobody knows how to invest. Even a monkey can a do a good investment. [Learn more about smart monkeys.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB991681622136214659)
