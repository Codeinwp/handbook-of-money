### If you are a programmer

...I can bet 20$ that you do not invest too much in programming tools or a comfy chair or exercise at regular hours. You can always find a good free tool that does a decent job of completing your task. But imagine how much mental energy you can save with the right tool that can answer your question before draining too much mental energy.
