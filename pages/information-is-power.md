# Information is power

> You can not win a war be living in ignorance - Robert

So you decided that you want to put some money in stocks, index funds, crypto, commodities, etc. And a natural question is: Which is the best now, in 5 years, or 20 years?

If you want to know that, you must be up-to-date with news (like you do with Twitter, Twitch, Instagram, and Reddit drama).

But first, we need to learn when news is an ad or sponsored content:

- [Sponsored Content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0lgW_mqOy8)
- [Sponsored Content: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIi_QS1tdFM)

DON'T be obsessive with public information and don't think you will find a reliable way to build a formula. Remember, significant events happen behind the curtain.

Don't stress yourself when investing; don't be obsessive with the numbers.

### Don't breake the bubble

```
A powerful idea here when we think about sponsored content and news is the incentives. Is there anything the writer/advertiser might win if you do as they say?

Like a real estate developer telling you to buy an apartment from him because it is the best time?

Have you seen a bunch of news that keep spaming the idea to invest in something that **MIGHT** give you some value at the **RIGHT** time?

#### Enters ECONOMIC BUBBLE in the scene.

```
An economic bubble is a situation in which asset prices are much higher than the underlying fundamentals can reasonably justify. Bubbles are sometimes caused by unlikely and overly optimistic projections about the future. They could also be described as prices which strongly exceed the asset's intrinsic value.

They are sometimes referred to as speculative bubbles, financial bubbles, or speculative mania.

In the early stages of a bubble, many investors do not notice the bubble for what it is. People notice the prices are going up and often think it is justified. Therefore bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, after the bubble has already popped and prices have crashed.

```

Bubbles are a big moment; some make tons of money, and some lose their lives. A bubble is a KINGMAKER and a KINGSLAYER at the same timeâ€”the double edge sword.

## Only the language can express your ideas.

```
Words are my eyes.
The eyes to my world.
The world of my beautiful mind.
Twisted and complex.
Only the right words,
Can open my world to you.

 - Robert, in a very poetic moment.
```

That's right; words make our world spin. Everything is built on the ideas, and those who understand its power are those to whom the world belongs.

The book [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) highlight the powerful idea behind the words of a language. Read more about [Newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak).

**Don't forget to read fantasy, poetry, or si-fi books; they are good at explaining new ideas using the current words in the language.**
