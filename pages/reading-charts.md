> Personally, I use the line chart more when I look at companies because I look at the last 1-3 years and how it has evolved from listing to the present. This makes it easier for me to make an impression. - Madalin

## Platforms

Choosing a platform depends a lot on the law & taxes of your country. You need to pay attention to the commissions of each forum. Beware of their marketing; they are very aggressive. It is better to ask some friends who use those platforms (ask them about additional contracts and how they cash out the money) to understand better how it will work for you.
