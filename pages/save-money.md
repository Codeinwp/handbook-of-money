# How to save money

Before saving money, you need to know where your money goes.

![Where are my money](../memes/where-are-my-money.jpeg)

Take a pen and a paper, or open a Spreadsheet App and write down how much money you have right now.

Example:

| Source | Amount |
| -- | :--: |
| Savings | 4000$ |
| Salary | 1000$ |


And now for monthly fixed (or almost fixed) expenses.

| Source | Amount |
| -- | :--: |
| Neftflix | 10$ |
| Internet | 15$ |
| Utilities (electricty, water, internet) | 130$ |
| Rent | 200 $ |

So, from your salary, you will remain with 645$. With those, you will spend them on food and other consumables. 

A good rule is to save 20% from your salary, in this case, 200$ . You will remain with 445$ .

From that 20%, half can go to a saving account, so 100$ . The other 100$ can to investment. With a salary of 1000$ , based on this formula, you will invest 1 200$ per year.

It looks like a really small sum, but it is a little over one month's salary. So one salary will go-to investment every year.

What about the 4000$ in savings? Well, you can not put all your money in investment. You will need it when urgency happens: you are fired, a medical problem appears, and your phone has stopped working.

If your savings are really big, then you can try to invest them in stocks, index funds, etc.

### Saving

You will find a lot of tips on how to save money, especially on sites like [r/povertyfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/wiki/index).

But you need to remember that some things have a hidden cost. The one of them is health. Health problems are like a debt, and like investment, they grow over the years (and unfortunatly they do not crash). This debt, might be so big that all the money that you saved over the years will not help.

Habbits have an hidden cost.

| Habbit | Cost |
| -- | :-- |
| Smoking | Health problem + daily cost of ciggars |
| Junk food | Health problems over the years |
| Social Media | Mental Health - low esteam that decrease productivy or increase consumerism |
| Greed | Not spending money tool that can save money and boost productivity or healthcare |
| Ignorance | Ignore your other problems |

Remember that you can invest in yourself (learn a skill, a new language, etc). 1 200$ can make a difference.

And the best way to do it is with a list:

1. Note down what you want to buy and how much it cost
2. Note a period in which you can think you can accumulate that sum.
3. Note every unexpected event (medical bills, gifts)
   
One problem with this is that you will hate when you see how carelessly you spend the money.

#### How other people see this side

```
I initially skipped this because I pretty much never think about saving in a way that most of the people would do, however I do have some principles.

I don't get in debt and I like to leave below my means, I always found it easier to think on how I can increase my earnings, in order to save more, rather than reduce my spending.

I also like to in a way artificially lower my monthly income to avoid spending too much, like I worked a couple of years basically for equity vs salary.

I think that while you are young there are simply lots of opportunities on the investment side, investing in yourself mostly so you can generate more income, rather than spending time thinking on how you can save.

Although saving 20% of the monthly income is recommended, sometimes I succeed, and sometimes I save only 10% (any amount is better than nothing) for various reasons and unexpected expenses that arise (someone hits your car and flees the scene of the accident - you have to repair it yourself; or some checks related to health, etc.).

Thinking that inflation will erode my money, every month, from the amount I decide to save, half I put in the savings account. For the other half, I try to invest in stocks (if the amount is not enough to cover what I want to purchase, I deposit the money anyway and buy when I have collected the amount I need).
Another good practice is to have a reserve account were to add 2-3 salaries for emergencies.

I save continuously because the things I like are very cheap: Pepsi twist, Lay's chips. Or **free**(digital pirate wink).
